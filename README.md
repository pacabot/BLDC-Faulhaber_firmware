# BLDC FAULHABER DRIVER ON STM32
This project demonstrates how to use STM32 to drive sensored bldc motor.
It's compatible with STM32H743 nucleo and nucleo-ihm11m1 extension board.
We have developped this driver using a sample of FAULHABER 0620 halls sensored brushless motor and 0824 with AESM absolute encoder.
Many thanks to Faulhaber!!!
